# IEOR 4501 Tools For Analytics -- Porject  

## Project Description
[TO DO]  
This project is to write a library for option value prediction propose:
- Create functions for option pricing by using 
    - Monte Carlo simulation 
    The method is to generate 'n' times simulation of the underlying assets' path (in this case are stocks) with each simulation has 
    
    - Binomial option pricing model (Cox, Ross and Rubinstein, CRR Model)
    
    - Black Scholes Formula with sensitivity analysis
    
    - Functions to gather stock data from public sources e.g. yahoo-finance or by doing real time web scarping on financial websites and use statistics package to sample necessary data for the simulations and formula mentioned.
    
    - Visualizations of all the methods are also presented to make users better understand the process and for further analysis. 
  
  The aim is to use financial data and models to predict European option value and compare the result across different methods.
