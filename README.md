# IEOR 4501 Tools For Analytics -- Porject  

## Project Description
[TO DO]  
This project is to write a library for financial analysis propose:
- Create functions for option pricing by using Monte Carlo simulation of the underlying assets' path, Binomial option pricing model (Cox, Ross and Rubinstein, CRR Model) and Black Scholes Formula (if applicable). These functions will gather stock data from public sources e.g. yahoo-finance or by doing web scarping on other websites and will use stat package to extract necessary data for the simulations and formula mentioned.

(This part is optional)
- Create functions that identify optimal weight of stocks in portfolio by extracting stat data and minimize variance of the portfolio across different level of expected returns then create an efficient frontier graph for that portfolio.
